\position{Lead Software Developer}{August 2021 - October 2023}{Nuvation Energy}{Waterloo, ON}
\lineSummary{Developing firmware for a scalable Battery Management System (BMS) in Modern C++ and Python.}
\listBegin
\listItem{Owned delivery of full software suite, from start to finish, for one MCU (STM32G0) in BMS. Operated in technical lead capacity, architecting solutions, planning tasks, managing team and reporting to stakeholders. Onboard, mentor, evaluate and report feedback on new hires.}
\listItem{Drove design, implementation, testing, refinement and documentation of firmware for this MCU, including its architecture, drivers, application FSMs, communication protocol and interface. Also led whole development of central MCU's (S7G2) software stackup (driver, API, thread) to manage STM32.}
\listItem{Planned, built, managed and documented tests and custom hardware for continuous validation at all levels (unit, integration, end-to-end) and for different purposes (accuracy, safety, stress). Regularly resolved bugs, regressions and instabilities in performance caught by tests.}
\listItem{Executed systematic and rigorous functional safety analysis on entire software suite. Identified potential failure modes, and developed mitigation techniques and tests. Presented analysis to UL auditor and provided tools to facilitate their external validation.}
\listItem{Designed, developed and documented manufacturing tests, test systems and other test infrastructure.}
\listItem{Gained expertise on main sensor (INA239) controlled by STM32. Was go-to point of contact for team on issues of speed, accuracy, stability, configuration and general use of this part.}
