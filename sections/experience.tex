\lineSummary{Developing firmware for a scalable Battery Management System (BMS) in Modern C++ and Python.}
\listBegin
\listItem{Operated as technical lead. Planned tasks and managed team. Mentored and evaluated junior developers.}
\listItem{Owned delivery of full software suite, from start to finish of SDLC, for one MCU (STM32G0) in BMS. Developed architecture, drivers, application FSMs, communication protocol and interface for this MCU.}
\listItem{Integrated with main MCU (S7G2) of BMS. Drove development of S7G2 software stack to control STM32.}
\listItem{Executed functional safety analysis of all software. Identified failure modes and implemented mitigations.}
\listItem{Designed and built test systems and tests for continuous validation at all levels (unit, integration, end-to-end, production) and for different purposes (accuracy, safety, stress).}
% \listItem{Gained expertise on main sensor (INA239) controlled by STM32. Was go-to point of contact for team on issues of speed, accuracy, stability, configuration and general use of this part.}
