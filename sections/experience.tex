\position{Lead Software Developer}{August 2021 - October 2023}{Nuvation Energy}{Waterloo, ON}
\lineSummary{Building firmware for a real-time, safety-critical embedded system (BMS) in C, Modern C++ and Python.}
\listBegin
\listItem{Oversaw sub-system as technical lead. Planned tasks, managed team of 5-8. Mentored junior developers.}
\listItem{Owned delivery of complete software stack, for isolated MCU (STM32) and sensors, through entire SDLC.
\newline Stack viz. architecture, drivers, HAL, application FSMs, custom communication protocol, register interface.}
% \newline SDLC: design, implementation, testing, refactoring, documentation, safety certification, manufacturing.
\listItem{Led engineering of multi-threaded stack, for central MCU (S7G2) to integrate with and manage STM32.}
\listItem{Executed functional safety analysis of all software. Identified failure modes, implemented risk mitigations.}
\listItem{Developed automated test systems and tests for validation at all levels (unit, integration, HIL, full system) and for all purposes (accuracy, safety, stress, ATP, manufacturing).}
% \listItem{Gained expertise on main sensor (INA239) controlled by STM32. Was go-to point of contact for team on issues of speed, accuracy, stability, configuration and general use of this part.}
