\lineSummary{Building firmware for a real-time, safety-critical embedded system (BMS) in C, Modern C++ and Python.}
\listBegin
\listItem{Oversaw sub-system as technical lead. Planned tasks and managed team. Mentored junior developers.}
\listItem{Owned delivery of isolated MCU's (STM32G0) complete software stack, through entire SDLC.
\newline Stack: architecture, drivers, application FSMs, external communication protocol, register interface.
\newline SDLC: design, implementation, testing, refinement, documentation, safety certification, manufacturing.}
\listItem{Led development of central MCU's (S7G2) multi-threaded stack to integrate with and manage STM32.}
\listItem{Executed functional safety analysis of all software. Identified failure modes, implemented risk mitigations.}
\listItem{Designed and built test systems and tests for continuous validation at all levels (unit, integration, end-to-end, production) and for all purposes (accuracy, safety, stress).}
% \listItem{Gained expertise on main sensor (INA239) controlled by STM32. Was go-to point of contact for team on issues of speed, accuracy, stability, configuration and general use of this part.}
